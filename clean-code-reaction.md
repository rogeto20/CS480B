1. Identify one point that illustrated something not to do that you do or tend to do.
    - I tend to nest too deeply with loops and if statements that make my work hard to read.
    
2. Identify one point that surprised you and explain why
    - Avoiding using singletons. From the Design Patterns class, it was one of the patterns that we were encouraged to use to create efficient software.
    
3. Identify one point that you disagree with, if any, and why
    - Using getters and setters. I think if an object and its properties are public, it is more efficient to get and set its values without having getters and setter methods that do the exact same thing.
